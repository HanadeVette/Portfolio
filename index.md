## Welcome to my portfolio. Here i will show you some of the things i've made during my study.

### Project 1

This is one of the games I have made with Unity. The goal was to create a 2 player game. Each player should have their own controls,
that do not interfere with one another. Both characters are also able to be controlled through the use of a controller.
Weapons respawn based on a timer. Walking into a weapon picks it up. If you already have a weapon it gets swapped out for the new one.
The camera moves in such a way that both players are always visible and scales based on distance from one another.


### Project 2

This is a retro game I made in C#. Started out completely from scratch and am quite proud of the result.
The game has a total of 4 difficulties. Based on the difficulty chosen your screen becomes smaller/bigger.
Rendering the tiles isn't crazy efficient but it gets the job done for pretty basic Tile rendering in C#.
The yellow button resets the game, so does Ctrl + N. Or you simply use the included menu.

This is a website that we at school. All data that is shown gets pulled from a database through the use of PHP.
You have the ability to edit the team and/or player names. There is a tournament bracket as well that we added through JQuery Bracket.
We used Bulma as our CSS framework. I personally used a lot of SASS because nesting makes life sooooo simple.


### Project 4
[![MOOD Demo Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NKjrSs14Om4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKjrSs14Om4 "MOOD Demo Video")

This is my most recent game i made. I fully the game from scratch excluding built-in Unity modules of course.
All assets have been drawn by myself. The art isn't of crazy high quality but the time limit was only 5 days including planning and documentation.
The game is a clone off the very popular game series Doom. I am a huge fan of it so it seemed like a good place to build from.
Made within a week i am quite happy how it turned out. Controls are pretty smooth and yeah there's a few hitbox issues here and there with raycasting.
But it doesn't really affect the gameplay that much for just a demo.
